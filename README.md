# Proximal Bundle Methods for Saddle Point Problems

This repository contains code containing implementations of Modern Proximal Bundle methods for saddle point problems. The implementation focuses on numerical experiments for $\ell_\infty$-regularized matrix games, with comparisons to classical subgradient methods.

## Features

- Proximal bundle method implementation for saddle point problems
- Experiments on $\ell_\infty$-regularized matrix games
- Benchmarking against subgradient methods

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    cd ProximalBundleSPP
    ```
2. Install dependencies (see `Project.toml`).

3. Run experiments:
    ```bash
    bash runtests.sh
    ```
